# PHP Silent Error: Missing Semicolon

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in PHP: missing semicolons at the end of statements.  While PHP often tries to infer the missing semicolon, this can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues. The example shows a function with a missing semicolon, leading to a potential error if another statement follows it without a proper separator.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle this.
